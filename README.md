# inventory-management-2.0

Inventory Management System "Papelon":
An effective inventory management system can significantly enhance the productivity of managers and teams. This web application is an MVP waiting on approval for corporate to start in production.


Full Stack application, Backeend in Nodejs using Express and MongoDB. MVC pattern with endpoints and Models. The Frontend is a React Application with Tailwindcss and Redux to manage the state. Additionally, I added authentication with Token validation and cookies, pagination, and KPIs using a Slice.


The MVP app was temporarily hosted by Vercell for the frontend and Render for the backend with free tiers. I changed the hosting to Render for both on a new version (it takes 50 seconds to load the first time you open the link, due to the server restart on a Render free tier).
